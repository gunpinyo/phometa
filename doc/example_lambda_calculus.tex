\chapter{Example Formal System - Lambda Calculus}
\label{chap:example_lambda_calculus}

Since the last two chapters show most of features and usability of \emph{Phometa}
already so this chapter aims to show that Phometa is powerful enough as it can
even encode more complex formal system like \emph{typed lambda calculus}. Hence,
it is clear that Phometa is suitable to encode most of formal system that user
can think of.

\section{Untyped Lambda Calculus}
\section{Simply-typed Lambda Calculus}

TODO: don't forget to write about unification (type resolution)
