\chapter{Conclusion}

At the end of this project. Phometa has been designed and been implemented up to
the level that is ready to use by anybody with a decent standard library and
tutorial. This, in tern, satisfies all of objective stated in introduction
chapter. In addition, I also believe that Phometa on this state is a potential
replacement for derivation-tree's manually-drawing so people don't have to
suffer from it tedious process and error prone anymore.

\section{Lesson Learnt}

Time management for research project is one of many thing that I have learnt
during this project. I learnt that tasks are always take time twice or thrice
longer than expectation so it is vital to spare plenty of time before the
deadline. More importantly, I learnt that better idea of feature always come
after we start to implement something. It is quite hard to decide whether
Phometa should include some curtain feature or not. It is about a tread off
between usefulness of the feature and the risk of the project being not finish
in time. This kind of features usually came near the end of implementation where
I knew exactly what Phometa should be. This is bad because if I accepted the
feature, this would take sometime to implement and edit related part of this
report, which in tern, would impact the entire schedule of the plan. So I
usually take it as future work as described in next section.

I also learnt to believe in myself being capable to building something I dream
of. Formal proof always be my favourite topic since I studied Logic in the first
year. One day, I was drawing a derivation tree for a coursework, I had the idea
of this project. At the first time it seemed too scary because it is about
building a proof assistant from scratch, however after evaluated proof of
concept, it turned out to be feasible. So I decide to start it and approached my
supervisor.

Most importantly, I learnt many thing regarding to formal proof from this
project which is relevant to the topic that I want to do for PhD (Dependent Type
Theory). This gave me more familiarity and confident in that field. Oppositely,
curiosity on the field motivated me to work on this project better since I know
that this kind of knowledge gained during the project will be useful later for
sure.

\section{Future Works}

Although Phometa designed and implement up to satisfactory level. There are
still plenty of room for improvement as the followng

\subsection{Make Grammars and Rules extensible}
\subsection{Make proving technique more autometics}
\subsection{Importation between Modules}
\subsection{Copy, Move, and Renaming on Packages and Modules}
\subsection{Export Grammars, Rules and Theorems to \LaTeX}
\subsection{Repository Verification on Loading}
\subsection{Adding new Formal Systems to Standard Library}
\subsection{Make Messages become more informative}
e.g.\ if pattern match when applying rule fails, it should tell why it falls
\subsection{Implement a proper server for Phometa}
\subsection{Make Interface to be more mobile friendly}
\subsection{User preference}
